## Presentation Prep!

#### VISUALLY test your presentation:
  - Once teams have MVP in place and are focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goals, take a few minutes at some point to go to a classroom (or even better, the main event space) and take a look at your app on a projector/screen setup.
  - Decide whose laptop you will use for the presentation, test its functionality, then test a second laptop just in case.
  - For presentation testing, focus only on how it looks: play with functionality only as a means of generating different views.
  - Make sure to look at every page, and take detailed notes of what you want to adjust (text size, text color, contrast between
  foreground and background, etc.)
  - You'll be glad you did this step of visual testing. So that "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!" happens sooner than later.

#### Plan your presentation:
  - Shoot for a presentation of 10 minutes; under no circumstances should you exceed 15 minutes.
  - It is better to leave your audience wanting more than to test the limits of their attention span.
  - Expect to take a few minutes after your 10 minute presentation to answer audience questions.
  - Start with each student giving an introduction: first and last names, background, and goals with studying code. Your “About Us” page (or your individual portfolios!) are a great backdrop for introductions.
  - Decide on who will say what during the presentation. It may be helpful to write up an outline of the presentation beforehand.
  - Who will give an intro to the project, and tell us about the problem domain and your team's solution?
  - Who will talk about the functionality, and walk the audience through a demo the app?
  - Who will talk about a technical obstacle (or two) that arose during project week and how your team overcame it?
  - Each person should describe some of what they contributed to the project and how that fit into the whole.
  - Every team member needs to speak! Build at least a skeleton of a script and work from it in your rehearsals.
  - Think about how to trade off speaking roles, and practice making that transition fluidly.
  - Generally, do not plan to show code unless asked (focus on the functionality!), but be ready to do so by having Atom open andthe text embiggened enough to be readable. No one wants to watch you launch Atom and muck around with the settings.
  - Who will show us the code, if you end up doing so? (not required, but if in response to a question, focus on the specifics)
  - Be sure to share a link to your deployed version, and provide contact information for your team members (email addresses, GitHub profiles, LinkedIn profiles, Twitter handles, any other relevant links) on a final slide or on your “About Us” page.
  - Load your website beforehand in case the wifi goes down, but you should run from your deployed version.

#### Rehearse your presentation:
  - One rehearsal is not enough (at least do it twice); ten is too many. Somewhere in there is the right number for your team.
  - Instructors and/or TAs will coach you through the process: they've all done this before.
  - Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics so you know how much time each segment will take.
  - If your team finds it is going over 10 minutes, refactor or trim out some pieces.
  - Practice with the microphone so that you are comfortable with it and know how far to hold it in front of your face.
  - Be careful of walking around with the microphone: if you step directly in front of the speakers there is a risk of feedback.
  - Make sure to practice how you intend to present­­speak clearly, don't keep your hands in your pockets, stand up straight, etc.

#### The actual presentation!
  - Showcase your product and your team as if you were trying to sell them, or gain investors.
  - There will be video recordings of the presentations that will go on YouTube.
  - No need to go formal, but dress reasonably nice.
  - Show that you take the presentation process seriously: BE PROFESSIONAL.
  - Think of your presentation as something you'd like a hiring manager to see
  - It’s very possible that a future boss will view this presentation, whether live or on video!
  - Speak clearly, and speak a little more slowly than you would ordinarily.
  - Avoid using slang or profanity. Be a consummate professional!
  - Don't give your presentation while holding a beer in your hand, chewing gum, etc.
